3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Relationships:

This section describes the relationships between tables in the data model. The connections were established to support accurate filtering, aggregation, and slicing of data across fact and dimension tables.

| From Table (Column)                            | To Table (Column)                                  | Relationship Type | Status  |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| `Product_Inventory (LocationID)`              | `Production_Location (LocationID)`                | One-to-One        | Active  |
| `Fact_PurchaseOrder (ModifiedDate)`           | `DimDate (Date)`                                  | Many-to-One       | Active  |
| `Fact_PurchaseOrder (ProductID)`              | `Product_ProductTable (ProductID)`                | Many-to-One       | Active  |
| `Fact_PurchaseOrder (PurchaseOrderID)`        | `Purchasing_OrderHeader (PurchaseOrderID)`        | One-to-One        | Active  |
| `Fact_PurchaseOrder (VendorID)`               | `Dim_Vendor (VendorKey)`                          | Many-to-One       | Active  |
| `Production_WorkOrderRouting (LocationID)`    | `Production_Location (LocationID)`                | Many-to-One       | Active  |
| `Production_WorkOrderRouting (WorkOrderID)`   | `Production_WorkOrder (WorkOrderID)`              | Many-to-One       | Active  |
| `Purchasing_ProductVendor (BusinessEntityID)` | `Purchasing_Vendor (BusinessEntityID)`            | Many-to-One       | Active  |

üìå Notes:
All relationships are active, ensuring smooth data model interactions.
The data model primarily follows a star schema pattern, where Fact_PurchaseOrder acts as the central fact table linked to multiple dimensions.
These relationships are key to enabling efficient drill-downs and cross-filtering in visualizations.

üìå Analysis 1:

Observation:

The total purchase spend is $33.2M across 1.2 million orders, with an average unit price of $27.29.

The top vendor by spend is Superior Bicycles with $2.28M, followed by Bicycle Specialists and Inline Accessories.

The top purchased product is from SUPERSALES INC. with 63K units, significantly ahead of others at 28K units.

Spending over time shows a strong upward trend, peaking at $3.3M, before dropping to $0.4M‚Äîindicating possible seasonality or demand spikes.

Recommendation:

Focus on maintaining relationships with top-performing vendors like Superior Bicycles.

Investigate the drop in spending at the end of the period to understand if it's due to inventory saturation, budgeting cycle, or supply disruptions.

Consider negotiating bulk deals with vendors supplying high-volume products such as SUPERSALES INC.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard 2 Preview

<img width="1001" height="561" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4bf2c7c-8e16-4131-9759-9e2d73fe7eb6" />

üìå Analysis 2:

Observation:

The total spend remains at $33.2M, but several issues with vendor performance are evident:

The average lead time is 14 days, but there is a significant discrepancy among vendors. For example, G & K Bicycle Corp. has a lead time of 141 days, while many others are only around
30 days.

A 100% late order rate is observed in multiple vendors such as Fitness Association, G & K Bicycle Corp., and Green Lake Bike Company, indicating high delivery risk and reliability concerns.

The highest rejected quantity rates come from Greenwood Athletic Company (5.68%), followed by Proseware, Inc., and SUPERSALES INC.

Spending is still concentrated on top vendors like Superior Bicycles, Bicycle Specialists, and Inline Accessories.


Recommendation:

Reassess vendors with excessive lead times and 100% late delivery rates to evaluate their supply capability and contractual obligations.

Prioritize renegotiation or replacement of vendors with high defect/rejection rates to minimize quality risks and reverse logistics costs.

Establish vendor performance KPIs (lead time, quality, punctuality, and spend) and monitor them periodically to improve supply chain resilience.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard 3 Preview

<img width="1001" height="562" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cca9af7-6ff8-4084-9e15-68a20ad53f1a" />

üìå Analysis 3:

Observations:

The Late Order Rate is relatively high at 29.9%, with 12 late deliveries recorded.

The vendors with the most late deliveries are Integrated Sport Products (4 late orders) and Green Lake Bike Company, Jeff‚Äôs Sporting Goods (2 each).

The Quantity Mismatch Rate stands at 5.21%, with over 12,599 mismatched items, primarily from International Sport Assoc. (574 items) and Anderson‚Äôs Custom Bikes (492 items).

The most frequently stocked-out product is LL Mountain Tire (122 times), followed by various pedal types (Touring, ML, HL).

The product categories with the highest quantity mismatches are Components (3.7K) and Accessories (1.6K) ‚Äî highlighting critical areas of concern in the supply chain.

Although 99.7% of deliveries are on time, the remaining 0.3% late deliveries may still impact customer satisfaction and service quality if left unaddressed.


Recommendations:
Implement early warning alerts for vendors with a track record of late deliveries, such as Integrated Sport Products and Green Lake Bike Company, to proactively manage delivery timelines.
Reassess supplier performance for those with high mismatch rates and consider applying stricter quality checks before accepting deliveries.
For products with frequent stockouts (e.g., tires and pedals), establish safety stock policies and enhance demand forecasting accuracy.
Include ‚ÄúDelivery Accuracy‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuantity Accuracy‚Äù as key metrics in the vendor KPI dashboard to monitor supplier performance in real time.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard 4 Preview

<img width="1000" height="563" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/083732d9-a784-40bf-94a2-f32f82c2abad" />

üìå Analysis 4:

Observations:

The overall Purchasing Health Score is relatively strong at 89.87, indicating good performance in procurement operations.

However, High-Risk Vendors account for 89%, and Delivery Risk is at 100%, signaling a serious concern in vendor reliability.

Price Stability is extremely volatile with a value of -152%, implying inconsistent pricing from suppliers.

The Order Rejection Rate is 4%, which is still manageable but should be monitored.

Over 80% of vendors have a low credit rating, and 89.42% of vendors fall into the high-risk category, reinforcing the need for supplier quality improvement.

Lead Time Trend and Total Order Quantity Trend both show a steady decline from August to October, suggesting potential disruptions in supply chain performance.

The Monthly Purchasing Cost has increased significantly from $0M in 2011 to $21M in 2014, indicating rising costs that require budget control.


Recommendations:

Review and evaluate vendor contracts, especially those contributing to high delivery risk and price instability. Focus on supplier negotiation and diversification.

Develop a vendor improvement program targeting low-credit and high-risk suppliers, or consider supplier replacement for persistent underperformance.

Conduct root-cause analysis on price fluctuations to determine whether volatility is due to market changes or vendor inconsistency.

Closely monitor lead time and order quantity trends, and work with operations and forecasting teams to anticipate and address demand issues.

Implement a scorecard-based vendor management system to track improvements over time across quality, reliability, cost, and responsiveness.

üìå Analysis 5:


Observations:
The Bunching Index is 1.50, which falls within the normal distribution, indicating that order placement is moderately spaced throughout the year.

There is a steady decline in monthly orders, dropping from 456 in July to 120 in October, which may point to seasonal purchasing behavior or demand fluctuations.

The Order Frequency over Time trend shows consistent growth, reaching 2.4K orders in 2014, suggesting an overall increase in procurement activity over the years.

100% of orders are categorized as small orders, highlighting a potential issue in purchasing strategy, particularly inefficiencies in batch ordering.

Products like HL Mountain Frame - Silver are repeatedly ordered in low quantities, indicating an opportunity to consolidate orders for efficiency.

The Order Frequency vs Unit Price scatterplot reveals several low-frequency, high-unit-price items, such as Touring-Panniers, Large and Rear Brakes, which could benefit from better planning.


Recommendations:

Consolidate small orders into fewer, larger batch purchases to reduce handling costs and improve supplier negotiations.

Review frequently ordered low-quantity items (e.g., HL Mountain Frame) and implement minimum order quantity (MOQ) policies to optimize supply chain flow.

Investigate declining monthly order trends for potential root causes such as seasonality, internal delays, or stock level planning.

Segment products based on order frequency and cost to define strategic procurement categories: high-cost low-frequency items should be reviewed for potential long-term contracts.

Implement automated reorder thresholds for consistently demanded items to avoid frequent small-volume purchases.

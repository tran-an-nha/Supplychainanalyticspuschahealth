Supply Chain Analytics – Puscha Health

I. The Story Behind the Project
At the beginning of this project, I placed myself in the shoes of a **Business Analyst** who had just been assigned to support the purchasing department of a fictional company.
They were facing a key issue: "Why are purchasing costs increasing, yet material shortages continue to disrupt production?"
Instead of simply building a dashboard, I set out to answer a bigger question: "Can data tell us something about the true health of our supply chain?"

II. Analytical Mindset
Rather than building one-off reports, I designed a comprehensive dashboard system centered around five essential business questions:
1. What are we buying – from whom – and at what price?
2. Which suppliers are performing the best? 
3. Where are the supply and delivery risks?
4. Is our entire purchasing process operating in a healthy way? 
5. How can we optimize our purchasing decisions?
   
For each question, I built a dedicated dashboard page and used Power BI to visualize the data in a clear and accessible way  with a focus on real decision-making, not just creating beautiful reports.

II. Dashboard Content
1.Purchase Overview
I started with a high-level picture: who are the top suppliers, how have purchasing trends evolved over time, what are the total expenses and order volumes?  
This page is designed to give senior leaders a “big picture” view at a glance.

2.Vendor Effectiveness
Spending more doesn’t necessarily mean a supplier is better. I analyzed on-time delivery rate, rejected orders, and average delivery time to assess true reliability.

3.Supply & Delivery Risks
This page helps the purchasing team quickly identify critical issues:  
- Which vendors consistently deliver late?  
- Which products often have quantity mismatches?  
- Which purchase orders require attention?

4. Purchasing Health
I built a composite score to measure the overall health of the purchasing process, combining five key factors: late delivery, price fluctuations, product risk, rejection rate, and supplier concentration.  
The idea: **Don’t wait until problems escalate — forecast early and improve proactively.**

5. Order Optimization
This final page focuses on efficiency:  
- Which products are being ordered too frequently in small quantities?  
- Can orders be consolidated?  
- Are we wasting on logistics?

This analysis supports smarter ordering policies and more effective supplier negotiations.

III. Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard development  
- **DAX**: Calculation of KPIs such as % of late deliveries, health scores, and order bunching index  
- **Star Schema Modeling**: Clean and scalable data structure using AdventureWorks tables

IV.  Key Learnings

- Data doesn’t speak unless we ask the right questions.
- Turning data into a *decision-making narrative* is more important than just visualizing it nicely.  
- I learned to think from an operational perspective — not just chasing revenue, but caring about the sustainability of the procurement system.

V. Next Development Steps

- Integrate inventory data to gain visibility into the full supply chain  
- Add aging report and cash flow analysis for the finance department  
- Recommend alternative suppliers automatically when risk thresholds are exceeded

I created this project not just to practice Power BI, but to sharpen my ability to ask better questions, understand business operations through data, and tell a story that leads to impactful decisions.
